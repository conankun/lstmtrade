    Description:
        The environment that agent can see is sequence of limit order book.
        The goal is to achieve maximum revenue through putting only market orders.

    Observation:

    Actions:
        Type: Discrete(3)
        Num     Action
        0       Buy
        1       Sell
        2       Wait

        Note: The agent is trading futures meaning the agent can sell first and buy back later.

    Reward: Depends if inventory if we have positive inventory or negative inventory

    Starting State: random starting state generated in Orderbook class

    Episode Termination: When there is no more data next bid or next ask terminate
